Overall Architecture Recap
Digital Identity and Authentication:

Backend: Users register via an EJS page (Node.js/Express).

Blockchain: Upon registration, the backend calls a smart contract (using Web3.js) to mint an NFT representing the digital identity. The NFT’s metadata (potentially hosted on IPFS) contains user details.

Database: User details are stored in PostgreSQL and the blockchain transaction hash (or related event data) is recorded for off-chain reference.

Academic Course Registration:

Backend: The registration page collects course selections.

Blockchain: The backend calls the smart contract function (e.g., registerCourse) to record the registration on-chain.

Database: The course registration details are saved in PostgreSQL and linked to the NFT digital identity.

Course Completion Certificates:

Backend: An administrator or automated process triggers certificate issuance through an EJS interface.

Blockchain: The smart contract function (e.g., issueCertificate) is called to mint an NFT representing the certificate, with metadata (possibly on IPFS) that details course completion.

Database: Certificate issuance records are saved along with the corresponding transaction hash.

Semester Fees Payment:

Backend: The fee payment page collects payment details.

Blockchain: The backend calls a payable smart contract function (e.g., payFees) to process the payment and mint an NFT as a receipt.

Database: Payment records, including the transaction hash, are stored in PostgreSQL.

Explanation
build/
Contains the JSON files generated by Truffle after compiling and migrating your Solidity contracts.

contracts/
Holds the Solidity source files for each module:

MyNFT.sol for digital identity NFTs.

MyCourseReg.sol for on-chain course registration.

CertificateNFT.sol for certificate issuance.

FeePaymentNFT.sol for processing fee payments.

migrations/
Scripts to deploy your smart contracts to your development blockchain (e.g., Ganache).

node_modules/
Where npm installs your project dependencies.

public/
Contains static files like CSS and client-side JavaScript that are served to users.

views/
Contains all EJS template files for rendering UI pages:

login.ejs and register.ejs for authentication.

dashboard.ejs as the main landing page after login.

course.ejs for course registration (with a dropdown and a popup for details).

certificate.ejs for certificate issuance (showing courses eligible for certificate generation).

fee.ejs for fee payment.

error.ejs to handle undefined routes or errors.

.env
Stores sensitive configuration values such as your PostgreSQL credentials and the server port.

db.js
Connects to PostgreSQL, checks if the nft_identity database exists (and creates it if not), and creates the required tables.

index.js
The main server file that:

Sets up the Express server and middleware.

Defines routes to render EJS views.

Provides API endpoints for user registration, login, course registration, certificate issuance, fee payment, and also includes metadata endpoints (such as /api/metadata/identity/:userId) so that the tokenURI can return JSON metadata from your backend.

package.json and README.md
Provide project configuration, dependencies, and documentation.
